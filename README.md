## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an ADAS system specifically designed for Indian road conditions. The system leverages the YOLOv8-Seg model for:
- **Road Segmentation**: Identifying and segmenting road areas.
- **Object Detection**: Detecting vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles.
- **Instance Segmentation**: Providing detailed masks for detected objects.

The model is trained on a diverse dataset of Indian roads, including various weather conditions, lighting scenarios, and road types.

---

## Features
- **YOLOv8-Seg Model**: State-of-the-art instance segmentation for accurate road and object detection.
- **Diverse Dataset**: Includes 45,000+ annotated images of Indian roads under various conditions.
- **Superpixel Segmentation**: Enhances segmentation accuracy using SLIC superpixel methods.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for mid-range resolutions (e.g., 854Ã—480) to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like brightness adjustment, noise addition, and blur effects to improve model robustness.

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 40 videos recorded across different Indian road scenarios, converted into 45,000+ annotated images. Key features of the dataset:
- **Road Types**: Highways, urban roads, rural roads, and more.
- **Weather Conditions**: Sunny, cloudy, rainy, and nighttime.
- **Annotations**: Generated using the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for efficient mask creation.

Dataset statistics:
- **Training**: 80%
- **Validation**: 10%
- **Testing**: 10%
